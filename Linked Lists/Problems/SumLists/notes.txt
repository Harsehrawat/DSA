You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each ndoe contains a single digit.
The digit is stored in reverse order, s.t. the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list

Ex. input : ( 6->1->7 ) + ( 2->9->5 ). That is, 617+295 
    output : 9->1->2
