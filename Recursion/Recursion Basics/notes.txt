When I sit down to write a recursive algorithm to solve a problem, I have found it to be helpful to go through the following thought process in order to decide how the recursive call should be structured:
1 : Break the problem I am trying to solve down into a problem that is one step simpler
2 : Assume that my function will work to solve the simpler problem — really believe it beyond any doubt
3 : Ask myself: Since I know I can solve the simpler problem, how would I solve the more complex problem?

try applying the thought process above to a few of the following problems — no loops allowed!
1 : Go through an array and print out all of the elements
2 : Determine whether or not a string is a palindrome
3 : Calculate a raised to the power of b
