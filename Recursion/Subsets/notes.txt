There are basically given conditions on which two differnet output format are asked :

Output Type 1 :->  (with duplicates)
in this type,apply normal thinking process of recursion that crossed ur mind for the given condition.


Output Type 2 :-> (without duplicates)
in this type, to satisfy w/out duplicates we need to follow a pattern :
first, sort the given array
now rather than running callback directly into rec. fn .. do them now into a for-loop..
the for-loop would run i from currentIndex till nums.length..
it would just conitnue if i > index && nums[i] == nums[i-1]
other differnce from type 1 is that..
here we would clear back-track and won't call our fn once again
