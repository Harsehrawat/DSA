Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. 
ex. i/p : "Mr John Smith"
    o/p : "Mr%20John%20Smith"

* Concept of StringBuilder & StringBuffer :
StringBuffer: A thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters that can be modified without creating new objects. Operations are synchronized, making it suitable for multi-threaded environments.
StringBuilder: A non-thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters. It offers better performance in single-threaded environments due to the absence of synchronization.


StringBuffer Use Cases
Multi-threaded Applications: For example, when two threads are appending data to the same string.
Logging Systems: To ensure thread-safe logging of messages.
StringBuilder Use Cases
Single-threaded Applications: For example, when manipulating strings in algorithms like permutations or combinations.
Temporary Buffers: Ideal for temporary string storage and manipulation in single-threaded operations.
