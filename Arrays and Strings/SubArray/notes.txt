For SubArray, There's basically four algo that can be used
1-> Brute Force
2-> Sliding Window : This can be used when we are guaranteed there's no -ve element in the array 
3-> Prefix Sum: Used when we need to deal w/ -ve numbers involved in array and for subArray where we've to keep process from starting of array
4-> Suffix Sum: Used when we need to process sum from end of the array. ex. Removing minimal elements from the end so the remaining subarray meets some criteria.
                                                                            Problems like “maximum score by removing elements from either end.”
