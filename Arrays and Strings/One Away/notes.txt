There are three types os edits that can be performed on strings: insert a charcater,remoev a charcater,replace a character.
Given two strings,write a function to check if they are one edit(or zero edit) away from each other.

ex. pale,ple : True
    pales,pale : True
    pale, bale : True
    pale, bake : false


* Approach : 
there are two cases : one where lenght mismatch due to insert or remove operation .
and second case when lenght equal but only one mismatch should be allowed

-> for first case : 
    traverse over longer string, keep i and j initially at 0,
    incr. both if matching,
    for mismatch .. inc. i and stick to j
    
-> for second case :
    the mismatch count > 1 : return false;
