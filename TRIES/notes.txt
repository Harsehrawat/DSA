-> Firstly, i've mentioned Tries/Foundation/files as package Foundation .. WHY ?

// benefit: 
Packages solve:

1.Name conflicts
Example:
Trie in one project
Trie in another library


2.Code organization
Foundation.Trie
Foundation.Main

3.Access control
Package-private becomes meaningful.

-> useof bin.. To manage .class files in a seperate folder
// to compile my .java into bin: 
// 1. go to folder contianing bin ( i.e. DSA/TRIES)
// 2. javac -d bin Foundation/*.java ( -d: destination)

// to run .class files present in bin 
// 1. go to folder contianing bin ( i.e. DSA/TRIES)
// 2. java -cp bin Foundation.Main  ( -cp: comile path)
